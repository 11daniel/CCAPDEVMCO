I organized the files:

CCAPDEV FOLDER:
- public folder
	- css folder
		- CSS FILES
	- js folder
		- JS FILES
	- media folder
		- IMAGES
- views folder
	- HBS FILES
- HTML FILES
- JSON FILES
- index.js


NOTES:
- Registration works
- Login works but not for newly registered users. Only for sample users inside index.js
- Profile page works
- In PROFILE PAGE, the logo at the top left should direct you back to home page, but somehow it says it cannot get
  index.html
- Settings/Profile page editing works but functionalities like change photo, edit bio, edit username, 
  change password do not work
- Home button INSIDE Settings page does not work (I made a temporary page for it). The error says it cannot find
  HOMEPAGE
- Logout button works
